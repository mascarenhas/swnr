  description: <p>The biopsion’s <em>Psychic Succor</em> now cures any poisons or diseases the subject may be suffering, albeit it requires Committing Effort for the day as an additional surcharge. Biowarfare organisms, exceptionally virulent diseases, or TL5 toxins may resist this curing, requiring a Wis/Biopsionics skill check at a difficulty of at least 10. Failure means that the adept cannot cure the target’s disease. This technique cannot cure congenital illnesses.</p>
