  description: <p>The biopsion can now shape their own or another willing target’s physical form as a Main Action, transforming a touched target into any humanoid form within 50% of their own mass. Claws and other body armaments can be fashioned equivalent to Light or Medium melee weapons and innate armor equivalent to AC 13. Gills and other environmental-survival alterations are also viable at the GM’s discretion, but flight is a bridge too far for this power.</p><p>A person can be impersonated down to the DNA level, provided a blood or hair sample is available. The use of this adds one System Strain point to the target that does not recover so long as the change is in effect. Applying <em>Metamorph</em> requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for as long as the change is to be maintained. If applied to a target other than the psychic, the power automatically ends if the psychic gets more than one hundred kilometers away.</p>
