  description: <p>Once per turn, as an On Turn action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene to create a telekinetic force construct at a visible point, provided it can fit within a three-meter cube. The force construct can be shaped in any way the psychic wishes, and can remain fixed in its location without external supports if desired. It is as sturdy as a TL4 construction and may be visible or invisible at the adeptâ€™s choice. The construct lasts until the end of the scene, until the psychic dispels it, or until it is smashed with 20 points of damage against AC 15.</p>
