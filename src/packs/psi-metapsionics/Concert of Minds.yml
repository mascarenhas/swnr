  description: <p>As an On Turn action, the metapsion may Commit Effort and form a psychic gestalt with one or more willing psychics within three meters, including up to one other psychic per Metapsion skill level. This gestalt persists as long as the Effort remains committed, regardless of the subsequent distance between psychics. On their own turn, any member of the gestalt may use any power or technique known by any other member, using the other member’s skill levels as necessary and paying any Effort cost from their own pool. This gestalt shares only psychic power, not thoughts or senses. At the end of each round in which one or more members have used some other member’s powers or abilities on their turn of action, the metapsion must Commit Effort for the scene or the gestalt drops and cannot be re-established for the rest of the scene.</p>
