  description: <p>The metapsion can conceal their own psychic abilities from metapsionic senses. They must Commit Effort for as long as they wish to cloak their powers. While hidden, only a metapsion with equal or higher skill in Metapsionics can detect their abilities with their level-0 or level-2 <em>Psychic Refinement</em> abilities. In such cases, an opposed Wis/Metapsionics roll is made between the metapsion and the investigator. If the investigator wins, the cloak is pierced, while if the metapsion wins, the investigatorâ€™s <em>Psychic Refinement</em> remains oblivious.</p>
