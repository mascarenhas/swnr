  description: <p>The psychic imprints a particular object or person on their psionic awareness. Provided the object is relatively intact and in range of their <em>Personal Apportation</em>, the psychic always knows its exact location and can teleport to within three meters of it with <em>Personal Apportation</em> even if it has moved from its original location. Imprinting an object requires an hourâ€™s meditation with it, and only one object can be imprinted at a time. If imprinting on a person, the target must be willing and cooperative to make the imprint. Objects must be at least one kilogram in mass to be effectively tracked.</p>
