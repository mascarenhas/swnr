  description: <p>Expert teleporters can be infuriatingly difficult to pin down. By Committing an additional Effort for the day as an Instant action, the adept can use <em>Personal Apportation</em> as an On Turn action, even if they’ve already used it once this round. Apporting itself costs whatever Effort it normally would, in addition to any techniques that augment it. <em>Rift Reduplication</em> can only be triggered once per round. </p><p>If the adept uses their powers to teleport into a location, perform an action, and then use <em>Rift Reduplication</em> to teleport back out, onlookers in the area will not have time to react to their action or attack the adept unless the onlookers have held their action explicitly to counter the psychic. Enemies who hold their action this way waste it entirely if the psychic does not give them a chance to attack or otherwise interfere. Such a lightning strike may be surprising to onlookers, but it doesn’t allow enough preparation time to count as an Execution Attack as described on page 52.</p>
